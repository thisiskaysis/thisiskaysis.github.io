## Project Requirements

### Content
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What aesthetic and technical choices did you make? 
- [x] At least one profile picture
- [x] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [x] Functional Contact Form
- [x] "Projects" section
- [x] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.

The actual content itself in terms of what was written wasn't too difficult to add to the website - I started with a basic layout based on the She Codes website we used as part of this lesson (my_first_website). I decided to have 4 pages - Index, About, Projects/Portfolio, and Contact. I spent the majority of the time working on my homepage (index.html), making aesthetic/design choices and playing around with colours, fonts, layouts and ideas. I made 3 articles to use as links to each page, inside an article container to control layout and reponsiveness.
​
### Technical

- [x] At least 2 web pages.

- [x] Uses semantic HTML.
