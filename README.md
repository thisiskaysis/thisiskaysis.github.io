## Project Requirements

### Content
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What aesthetic and technical choices did you make? 
- [x] At least one profile picture
- [x] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [x] Functional Contact Form
- [x] "Projects" section
- [x] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.

I wanted to create a website that felt more creative and showed my personality a little. The background image combines my loves of anime, the night sky, and feels a little ethereal. The girl sitting on the right feels like me - looking up to the stars, dreaming about possibilities, manifesting ideas. I knew I wanted to use purples, greens, blues being my favourite colours - and once I decided on background image I wanted to make each section blend using opacity. I noticed that it may make the text harder to read, so I added hover effects to help with readability. The icon choices also needed to fit the theme - I chose to add links to Github, LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram (although I will probably delete the social media at a later stage - I just wanted more than 2 for the aesthetics!). The projects section is currently blank, but I will have content to put here soon! I struggled mostly with condensing my ideas into something cohesive, creating a website that is easy and pretty to use, but not over-the-top.
​
### Technical
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What strategies or design decisions did you work from? 
- [x] At least 2 web pages.
- [x] Version controlled with Git
- [x] Deployed on GitHub pages.
- [x] Implements responsive design principles.
- [x] Uses semantic HTML.

I wanted to create 4 pages - index, about, projects, contact. I used the template of my_first_website as a basis to work from, changing and adapting it as I learnt new skills each week. I controlled all versions with Git, committing changes frequently and working on branches for any new details or ideas, then merging to main. (Take a look at my "dev" branch to see what my website initially looked like!)
In terms of responsiveness, I chose to have my articles in landscape (row) on wider screens (computer size), and stacked in a column on smaller screens (phone size). I changed the opacity to be darker on phone screens for readability since hover effects won't work.
I tried to use semantic HTML through the entire code, however I had to use < div > once in order to get my animation working - I tried to use < ul > and < li > but couldn't get the animation to function (troubleshooting that... fun times).

### Bonus (optional)
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below, if you included any. 
- [x] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [ ] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra tricky!)

I loveeeee hover effects! I used many hover effects through my website:
- On articles: contrast 150% for better readability.
- On buttons: transform scale and translateY + box-shadow to add raise effect, as well as colour change.
- On < nav > menu: colour change, pointer change.
- On social media icons: transform scale.

### Screenshots
> Please include the following:
> - The different pages and features of your website on mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes (multiple screenshots per page and screen size).
> - The different features of your site, e.g. if you have hover states, take a screenshot that shows that.  
> 
> You can do this by saving the images in a folder in your repo, and including them in your readme document with the following Markdown code:
