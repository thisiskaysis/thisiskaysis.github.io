## Project Requirements

### Content
 Add a short paragraph describing the features below. What aesthetic and technical choices did you make? 
- [x] At least one profile picture
- [x] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [x] Functional Contact Form
- [x] "Projects" section
- [x] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.

I wanted to create a website that felt more creative and showed my personality a little. The background image combines my loves of anime, the night sky, and feels a little ethereal. The girl sitting on the right feels like me - looking up to the stars, dreaming about possibilities, manifesting ideas. I knew I wanted to use purples, greens, blues being my favourite colours - and once I decided on background image I wanted to make each section blend using opacity. I noticed that it may make the text harder to read, so I added hover effects to help with readability. The icon choices also needed to fit the theme - I chose to add links to Github, LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram (although I will probably delete the social media at a later stage - I just wanted more than 2 for the aesthetics!). The projects section is currently blank, but I will have content to put here soon! I struggled mostly with condensing my ideas into something cohesive, creating a website that is easy and pretty to use, but not over-the-top.
​
